Store managers have access to a tailored dashboard that tracks their individual store's performance in areas like sales figures,
order volume, and inventory management.

### Product Dashboards (Individual Items): 
These granular dashboards offer insights into the performance of specific menu items, enabling informed decisions regarding
product optimization and promotions.
